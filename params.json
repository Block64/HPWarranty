{"name":"HPWarranty","tagline":"PowerShell module to help retrieve Hewlett-Packard Warranty Information","body":"# HP has recently changed how the ISEE functions, and this module does not work at the moment.\r\n\r\n# EDIT: It is kind of working again, im still testing.  Feel free to try it out.\r\n\r\n# HPWarranty PowerShell Module\r\n\r\nThis module can be installed from the [PowerShellGallery](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/HPWarranty/).  You need [WMF 5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44987) to use this feature.\r\n```PowerShell\r\nInstall-Module -Name HPWarranty\r\n```\r\n\r\nHP has recently split into two divisions, and this a first attempt to support both HP server and workstation warranty via PowerShell.\r\nI currently have no way to check if a machine is a 'Server' or a 'Workstaion', so that falls on you, for now.\r\nThis is still very beta, so pleae report any issues.  Thanks.\r\n\r\n## HPWarranty Cmdlets\r\n\r\n* [Get-HPServerWarrantyEntitlement]()\r\n* [Get-HPWorkstationWarrantyEntitlement]()\r\n\r\nBasically, to use HPs ISEE to get warranty info, there are a few things that need to happen:\r\n\r\n\r\nExample 1:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n# Execute from local HP workstation.\r\nGet-HPWorkstationWarrantyEntitlement\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample 2:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n# Execute against remote HP workstation (must be on).\r\nGet-HPWorkstationWarrantyEntitlement -ComputerName 'MyFriendsHP.ourdomain.org'\r\n```\r\n\r\nExample 3:\r\n```PowerShell\r\n# Execute against multipule HP workstations\r\n@('HP1', 'HP2') | Get-HPWorkstationWarrantyEntitlement\r\n```","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
