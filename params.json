You need [WMF 5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44987) to use this feature.\r\n```PowerShell\r\nInstall-Module -Name HPWarranty\r\n```\r\n\r\nHP has recently split into two divisions, and this a first attempt to support both HP server and workstation warranty via PowerShell.\r\nI currently have no way to check if a machine is a 'Server' or a 'Workstaion', so that falls on you, for now.\r\nThis is still very beta, so please report any issues.
